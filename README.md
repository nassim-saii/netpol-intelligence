## 📌 Project Overview

**NPI** is a six-layer security observability platform for **OpenShift / Kubernetes clusters** that combines live network flow analysis, statistical and machine-learning anomaly detection, automated NetworkPolicy compliance auditing, and an on-cluster LLM assistant into a single intelligence layer sitting on top of **OVN-Kubernetes**.

Rather than relying on a human to manually inspect `NetworkPolicy` YAML for security gaps, or to eyeball dashboards for suspicious traffic, NPI watches cluster-native signals — OVN ACL drop logs, live `NetworkPolicy` objects, and time-series flow statistics — and turns them into structured findings, ranked anomalies, and plain-English explanations a security engineer can act on immediately.

This project was developed as a **PFE (End-of-Study Engineering Project)** at **NextStep IT** (Tunis, Tunisia), in partnership with **TEK-UP University**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect anomalous network flows in real time using statistical and ML-based methods
- Automatically audit Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources against a security rule catalogue
- Correlate anomalies and policy violations into a single compliance score per namespace
- Provide natural-language explanations and remediation guidance via an on-cluster LLM — with no data ever leaving the cluster
- Demonstrate zero-trust NetworkPolicy design on a real bare-metal OpenShift cluster running OVN-Kubernetes

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

NPI is built as **six cooperating layers**, deployed as independent microservices in the `netpol-system` and `llm-system` namespaces:

| Layer | Component | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Observability | Fluent Bit → Loki | Collects OVN-Kubernetes ACL flow/drop logs cluster-wide |
| 2. Flow Processing | `flow-processor` | Converts raw OVN drop events into structured flow records, builds per-namespace-pair baselines (Welford online algorithm) |
| 3. Anomaly Detection | `anomaly-detector` | Three-tier detection: Welford/Z-score statistical spikes, deterministic rule matches, and Isolation Forest (scikit-learn) for multivariate outliers |
| 4. Policy Audit | `audit-engine` | Watches live `NetworkPolicy` objects via the Kubernetes API and evaluates them against an 8-rule security catalogue (NP-001–NP-008) |
| 5. Intelligence | `llm-service` (Ollama / `llama3.2:3b`) | Generates plain-English explanations, attack-scenario framing, and YAML remediation for findings — fully on-cluster, streamed via SSE |
| 6. Presentation | `api-gateway` + `netpol-dashboard` (React 18) | REST + SSE API and a live dashboard: namespace map, anomaly timeline, compliance report, and an LLM-powered chat assistant |

All data is persisted in **TimescaleDB** hypertables and visualized live in **Grafana**.

## 🐳 Prebuilt Images

All six services are published as standalone, portable images on Docker Hub — no OpenShift `BuildConfig` required to redeploy elsewhere:

| Service | Image | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `audit-engine` | [`nassimsai/audit-engine`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nassimsai/audit-engine) | NetworkPolicy compliance audit engine (NP-001–NP-008) |
| `flow-processor` | [`nassimsai/flow-processor`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nassimsai/flow-processor) | OVN ACL drop-log → flow record + baseline builder |
| `anomaly-detector` | [`nassimsai/anomaly-detector`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nassimsai/anomaly-detector) | Z-score, rule-based, and Isolation Forest anomaly detection |
| `llm-service` | [`nassimsai/llm-service`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nassimsai/llm-service) | On-cluster LLM orchestration (Ollama client, SSE streaming) |
| `api-gateway` | [`nassimsai/api-gateway`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nassimsai/api-gateway) | FastAPI REST + SSE gateway for the dashboard |
| `netpol-dashboard` | [`nassimsai/netpol-dashboard`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nassimsai/netpol-dashboard) | React 18 SPA (multi-stage build → nginx) |

Each image is tagged `latest` and `v1.0-pfe2026` (defense snapshot).

```bash
docker pull docker.io/nassimsai/audit-engine:v1.0-pfe2026
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — Deploy on OpenShift using prebuilt Docker Hub images (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nassim-saii/netpol-intelligence.git
cd netpol-intelligence

# Create namespaces
oc apply -f deploy/namespaces.yaml

# Create secrets (fill in your own credentials first — see deploy/secrets.example.yaml)
oc apply -f deploy/secrets.yaml

# Deploy TimescaleDB, Kyverno policies, and all six services
oc apply -f deploy/
oc rollout status deployment/audit-engine -n netpol-system
oc rollout status deployment/flow-processor -n netpol-system
oc rollout status deployment/anomaly-detector -n netpol-system
oc rollout status deployment/llm-service -n netpol-system
oc rollout status deployment/api-gateway -n netpol-system
oc rollout status deployment/netpol-dashboard -n netpol-system
```

Full step-by-step instructions (including Ollama model pull, Grafana dashboard import, and Kyverno setup) are in [`NPI_Deployment_Runbook.md`](docs/NPI_Deployment_Runbook.md).

### Option B — Build from source inside OpenShift (original air-gap-capable pipeline)

```bash
oc new-build --name=audit-engine --binary --strategy=docker -n netpol-system
oc start-build audit-engine --from-dir=services/audit-engine/ --follow
# repeat per service — see docs/NPI_Deployment_Runbook.md, Section 3
```

> ℹ️ Option A trades the original air-gap build guarantee for portability — the images are built with internet access and pushed to Docker Hub, but the resulting deployment needs no OpenShift-internal build step and can be redeployed on any cluster with a `docker pull`.

## 🔍 NetworkPolicy Audit Rule Catalogue

| Rule ID | Severity | Check |
|---|---|---|
| NP-001 | HIGH | Default-deny ingress present per namespace |
| NP-002 | CRITICAL | Overly permissive ingress (`{}` selector) |
| NP-003 | HIGH | Missing egress restriction |
| NP-004 | MEDIUM | Missing DNS egress rule (ports 53 **and** 5353) |
| NP-005 | MEDIUM | Namespace label selector best practices |
| NP-006 | LOW | Policy naming/documentation conventions |
| NP-007 | HIGH | Cross-namespace traffic without explicit allow |
| NP-008 | CRITICAL | Router ingress path missing dual namespace selector |

Findings feed a per-namespace **compliance score**: `100 − (CRITICAL×20 + HIGH×10 + MEDIUM×5 + LOW×2)`, graded A–F.

## ⚠️ Known Operational Behaviours

- `oc start-build` does **not** auto-cycle running pods — always follow with `oc rollout restart`
- Ollama deployment strategy must be `Recreate` (two 10+ vCPU pods cannot coexist on one node)
- OVN-Kubernetes evaluates DNS post-DNAT — allow **both** ports 53 and 5353 in egress rules
- OCP Router ingress NetworkPolicies require **two** separate `from:` entries (namespace-name selector *and* `policy-group=ingress`)

Full list in [`docs/NPI_Deployment_Runbook.md`](docs/NPI_Deployment_Runbook.md).
